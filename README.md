Have you ever wondered where dinosaurs REALLY went?
Do you ever look at fossilized dinosaur bones and think, "Hmm...that's just a really big chicken."
If you answered no, then you need to WAKE UP!
Dinosaurs didn't go extinct-they just got smaller. 
And dumber. 
But just as cute and a lot less dangerous.
(sort of)

Look through the selection of images provided for you, and take away new knowledge and understanding of our flying feathered friends.
They have the same legs, same feet and claws, they also both screech and honk at you while trying to bite your ankles.
But, look on the brightside-
would you rather be chased by a duck or a T-Rex?
